# Midi2OSC
Arduino midi to OSC converter 

I use it with a Novation Launch Control connected to a Kenton USB to midi convert to adjust Bus 1 send levels on a Behringer XR12 digital mixer.

Don't know how efficient the code is...

Arduino Uno R3 with Ethernet shield.

See https://www.notesandvolts.com/2015/02/midi-and-arduino-build-midi-input.html on how to build an Arduino midi input.
